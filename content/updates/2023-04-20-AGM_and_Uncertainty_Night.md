Hey everyone!

As of yesterday's committee meeting we've scheduled our next two events, both of which will take place next week.

Firstly, we'll be holding our AGM on Tuesday at 5pm to elect committee for the remainder of this term and the beginning of next term. The location is yet to be confirmed but it will most likely take place in logic house. The reason we're once again doing elections so soon after the last set is because all societies have to hold an AGM at the end of the year.

Secondly, we're holding **Uncertainty night** on tuesday from 6pm, in which we will be watching a movie which we will decide randomly from the following selection: 
> Flatland  
> Interstellar  
> The man who knew infinity  
> Tenet  
> Inception  

We will(?) also be doing a kahoot!

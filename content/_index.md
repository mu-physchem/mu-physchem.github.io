### Welcome!

Black holes, quantum mechanics, x-rays, nuclear fusion, liquid nitrogen, supernovae, special relativity, rocket science, all of biology, all of engineering, none of sociology, metaphysics, particle accelerators, cosmology, applied philosophy, stargazing, ooblek!

If you like those things ^ then you either like physics and chemistry, or you haven’t figured out that you like physics and chemistry yet (there’s still time for you!)

Join us for pub quizzes, guest speakers, networking, museum trips, food, stargazing, and to talk about all things in the study of matter.

### Reach out

We are one of Maynooth's youngest societies, and we are very excited to grow our membership and our operations. Feel free to reach out to our committee if you're not sure about joining, and we'll be happy to let you know anything.

If you have any ideas to collab with us intra or inter varsity then know we'll be more than happy to oblige.
